## 🚶 Step-by-Step: Tracking a Transaction

### ✅ Step 1: Get the Transaction Hash

You can get a transaction hash from:
- Your **wallet** (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet)
- A **crypto exchange** after sending/receiving funds
- A **friend** who sent you ETH or a token

The hash looks something like this:
0x5e3b1a20c3f1a99e4b6cf03c0e3d6d4b5379c87e1e19738c7a7c7f9b7768ecdd

Open the website and paste the transaction hash into the **search bar** at the top, then press Enter.

### ✅ Step 3: Understand the Transaction Details

Once the page loads, you’ll see the full transaction info. Key fields include:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | Whether it succeeded or failed |
| **Block** | The block number it was included in |
| **Timestamp** | When it was confirmed |
| **From / To** | Sender and recipient addresses |
| **Value** | Amount of ETH transferred |
| **Gas Fee** | Fee paid to miners |

You can also click on the addresses or tokens involved to explore further details.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- If your transaction is **pending**, it may still be waiting for confirmation.
- If it's **failed**, it could be due to low gas or a contract error.
- You can click the **Txn Fee** link to see how much you paid in USD.
